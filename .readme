Hello. Myself Abdulla Mulla.

There's nothing much to say but:
1. First I started with creating a separate folder, inside the folder I created 1 html file, 1 .git folder to track files, 1 .readme file, and at last 1 jpeg file of live preview of the page.
2. Inside the index.html file I started to write keeping in mind of HTML5 Semantic Elements.
3. Once after completing I initialized git and linked to github.
3. And finally I would say it was fun and easy to make.
